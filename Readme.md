> The chief of the lcu realm

Vi is target to run as windows service, it is a light weight process, which watches if League of Legends is running and can provide the LCU API credentials to communicate with the LCU endpoints.
> NOTE: first, this project would be called 'orianna', but we think Vi has more appeal dealing with crimes 🚔🚔
