## How it works ?
Vi is a process which runs in background at OS level. This means it costs very low resources to use it, the goal is utilize the minimum amount of resources, in order to be very light weight.
In order to have this level of interaction at system level, it's more effective utilizes a more appropriated language, like c# or c++.
